    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the egg into a small bowl or ramekin.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Carefully pour in the egg and reduce the heat to low. Cook, uncovered, for 1 minute, then cover and cook until the whites are just set, 2 to 3 minutes. For an over easy egg, carefully flip the fried egg and cook until the whites are fully set, about 15 seconds, longer for an over medium or over hard egg. Transfer to a plate and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
